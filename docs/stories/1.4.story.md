# Story 1.4: Officer and Appointments Endpoints Implementation

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to implement officer-related endpoints including appointments and disqualifications,
**so that** users can retrieve detailed information about company officers and their appointments across companies.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Officers endpoint returns list of officers for a company
2. Appointments endpoint returns all appointments for a specific officer
3. Disqualified officers endpoint returns disqualification details
4. All responses use proper Pydantic models for validation
5. Proper error handling for invalid officer IDs and company numbers
6. Rate limit information is properly extracted and returned
7. Pagination is handled correctly for appointments endpoint
8. Officer date of birth is properly handled (month/year only for privacy)
9. Unit tests achieve 100% coverage of new code
10. Integration tests verify endpoint behavior with mocked responses

- Pagination handling implemented for search_all
- Base request patterns available in AsyncClient

From Story 1.2 (Core Client and Base Models):
- AsyncClient base class with request method available
- Exception hierarchy established
- RateLimitInfo model available
- Address model exists for officer addresses

### API Endpoint Details
From architecture [Source: architecture/external-apis.md]:

**Company Officers**:
- Endpoint: `/company/{company_number}/officers`
- Parameters: `items_per_page`, `start_index`, `register_type`, `register_view`, `order_by`
- Returns: Paginated list of company officers
- Default: 35 items per page

**Officer Appointments**:
- Endpoint: `/officers/{officer_id}/appointments`
- Parameters: `items_per_page`, `start_index`
- Returns: All appointments across companies for an officer
- Includes both active and resigned appointments

**Disqualified Officers**:
- Endpoint: `/disqualified-officers/natural/{officer_id}`
- Returns: Disqualification details for natural persons
- Endpoint: `/disqualified-officers/corporate/{officer_id}`
- Returns: Disqualification details for corporate officers

### Model Specifications

**Officer Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Officer]:
```python
- officer_id: str - Unique officer identifier
- name: str - Officer's full name
- officer_role: str - Director, secretary, etc.
- appointed_on: date - Appointment date
- resigned_on: Optional[date] - Resignation date if applicable
- date_of_birth: PartialDate - Month/year only for privacy
- nationality: str - Officer's nationality
- occupation: str - Stated occupation
- address: Address - Service address
```

**Appointment Model** (derived from API):
```python
- company_number: str - Company the appointment is with
- company_name: str - Name of the company
- company_status: str - Status of the company
- officer_role: str - Role in this company
- appointed_on: date - Date appointed to this role
- resigned_on: Optional[date] - Date resigned from this role
- address: Address - Service address for this appointment
```

**Disqualification Model** (derived from API):
```python
- disqualified_from: date - Start date of disqualification
- disqualified_until: date - End date of disqualification
- reason: str - Reason for disqualification
- court_name: Optional[str] - Court that issued the order
- court_order_date: Optional[date] - Date of court order
- undertaking_date: Optional[date] - Date of undertaking if applicable
```

### Privacy Considerations
From coding standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Officer date of birth must ONLY include month and year
- Never expose full birth dates in any response
- Use PartialDate type to enforce this at the model level
- Add clear documentation about privacy compliance

### Critical Implementation Rules
From coding standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Never use print() - use structlog logger exclusively
- All public methods must have type hints
- All API responses must use Pydantic models
- Validate officer IDs for correct format
- Rate limit headers must always be checked and logged
- Handle pagination properly with default values

### Testing

#### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

**Test Organization:**
- Unit tests in `tests/unit/test_officer.py`, `test_appointments.py`, `test_disqualifications.py`
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/test_officer_endpoints.py`
- Use respx for mocking HTTP responses
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- 100% code coverage requirement

**Specific Test Cases:**
- Test officer list for companies with 0, 1, many officers
- Test pagination for companies with >35 officers
- Test appointments pagination with multiple pages
- Test officer ID validation (valid/invalid formats)
- Test 404 handling for non-existent officers/companies
- Test privacy compliance (PartialDate conversion)
- Test disqualification with various statuses
- Test error mapping to custom exceptions
