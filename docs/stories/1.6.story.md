# Story 1.6: Retry Logic and Rate Limiting Implementation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer using the ukcompanies SDK,
**I want** automatic retry logic for rate-limited requests,
**so that** my application can handle API rate limits gracefully without manual intervention.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Client supports automatic retry for 429 (rate-limited) responses
2. Configurable retry parameters: auto_retry, max_retries, backoff strategy
3. Exponential backoff with jitter implemented for retry delays
4. Fixed backoff strategy available as alternative option
5. Respect X-Ratelimit-Reset header for intelligent wait times
6. Optional on_retry callback for logging/monitoring retry attempts
7. Proper error propagation when max retries exceeded
8. Rate limit information extracted and included in RateLimitError
9. Retry logic is non-blocking and maintains async behavior
10. Unit tests achieve 100% coverage of retry module
11. Integration tests verify retry behavior with mocked 429 responses

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.5 (Filing History and Document Endpoints):
- Rate limit extraction patterns established in client methods
- RateLimitInfo model available for rate limit data
- Pattern for handling 429 responses in integration tests

From Story 1.2 (Core Client and Base Models):
- AsyncClient base class with request method that needs retry wrapping
- Exception hierarchy established with RateLimitError
- httpx.AsyncClient usage patterns established

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- `src/ukcompanies/retry.py` - New retry logic module
- `src/ukcompanies/client.py` - Update AsyncClient to integrate retry logic
- `src/ukcompanies/exceptions.py` - Update RateLimitError with new fields
- `src/ukcompanies/config.py` - Add retry configuration constants
- `tests/unit/test_retry.py` - Unit tests for retry module
- `tests/integration/test_retry_logic.py` - Integration tests for retry behavior

### Retry Implementation Details
From PRD requirements [Source: prd/features.md#Retry-Logic]:
- Automatic retry for rate-limited requests (429 status)
- Configurable parameters:
  - `auto_retry`: Enable/disable automatic retries
  - `max_retries`: Maximum retry attempts (default: 3)
  - `backoff`: Strategy ("exponential" or "fixed")
  - `on_retry`: Optional callback for logging
- Must respect `X-Ratelimit-Reset` for accurate delay

### Rate Limit Headers
From API documentation [Source: architecture/external-apis.md]:
- `X-Ratelimit-Remain`: Remaining requests in current window
- `X-Ratelimit-Limit`: Total requests allowed in window (600)
- `X-Ratelimit-Reset`: Unix timestamp when limit resets
- Headers must be parsed and included in retry logic

### Backoff Strategies
From error handling strategy [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#External-API-Errors]:
- Exponential backoff with jitter
- Max 3 retries by default, configurable via client
- Base delay calculation: `min(2^attempt * base_delay + jitter, max_delay)`
- Jitter range: 0-1 seconds randomly added
- Base delay: 1 second
- Max delay: 60 seconds

### Callback Signature
The on_retry callback should have this signature:
```python
async def on_retry(attempt: int, wait: float, response: httpx.Response) -> None:
    """
    Called before each retry attempt.
    
    Args:
        attempt: Retry attempt number (1-based)
        wait: Seconds to wait before retry
        response: The 429 response that triggered retry
    """
```

### Critical Implementation Rules
From coding standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Never use print() - use structlog logger exclusively
- All public methods must have type hints
- Use httpx.AsyncClient context manager properly
- Rate limit headers must always be checked and logged
- All async functions must be prefixed with async
- Never block the event loop with synchronous sleep

### Configuration Constants
Add to config.py [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
```python
DEFAULT_AUTO_RETRY = True
DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES = 3
DEFAULT_BACKOFF_STRATEGY = "exponential"
BASE_DELAY = 1.0  # seconds
MAX_DELAY = 60.0  # seconds
JITTER_RANGE = 1.0  # seconds
```
